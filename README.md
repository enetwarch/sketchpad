# Sketchpad

A simple sketchpad website with simple functionality. This is a simple **JavaScript exercise** from [The Odin Project Etch-a-Sketch Activity](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). The sketchpad has the following features: 

* **Erase**: **Tap** the erase tool to toggle it, making the user inputs leave a white color. **Holding** the erase tool will ask a confirmation that allows the user to clear the entire sketchpad at once.
* **Rainbow**: **Tapping** this tool will toggle it, making the user inputs leave a random color instead of pure black.
* **Settings**: **Tap** this tool to change the grid size of the sketchpad.
